# Tower Rotation Solver

This project implements various search algorithms to solve a tower rotation problem.
The algorithms used include Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS),
Greedy Best-First Search, and A* Search.

## Instruction and dependencies
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the cube tower.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
- **Tracemalloc**: For tracking memory allocations.

You can then run:
python precode.py
